Introduction to python: Dynamic memory advantages : By python
Translator => it is software it convert the high level language to low level language => high to low => interpreter
operators => 
Data Type=> Primitive := Single Value data type ex a=10, it is immutable ,single length ==> int,float,boolean,none,tuple, string

           Non primitive : = it can store multi level value type  ,ex: N =[10,20,30] mutable => list,dictionary, set
Variable :
int : = number without decemial value 
Ex: 
string=> string is immutable '',"" "",""" """ single ('',""),document("' "',""" """)

List==>
[],Mutable,it will slicing
Tuple==>immutable,ordered


list is a mutable data type, it support the slicing it is faster than tuple

tuple is a immutable data type,it support the slicing ,tuple is faster than list
set : it is note point
